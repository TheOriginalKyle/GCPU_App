This was our second project for CIS 231 (Intro to Java Programming). The goal of the project was basically to create a small text adventure game similar to Zorg but not nearly as complex (or fully featured). I've included basically everything I needed to turn in for the project and ended up with a B on the project. Only wish I had time to do the extra credit but... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
